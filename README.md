# In-Deep-Sheet

Source code for a reaction flick shooter I made for the Lost Relic Game Jam. The game was made over the course of a week alone and scored 23rd out of almost 400 entries in the art category. In Deep Sheet was my second game made in Unity and my first jam entry.

The game can be played on itch at the link below.
